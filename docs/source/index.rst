========================================
A Library for Mechanistic Interpretability of Brain-Aligned Models
-------------------------------------------------------------------
This is a library for pre-processing/computing various brain alignment datasets/metrics and integrating these metrics
with existing mechanistic interpretability tools such as `TransformerLens <https://transformerlensorg.github.io/TransformerLens/>`_. This documentation provides a detailed guide on how to use its functionalities. It also provides details on the calculation of brain alignment, activation and path patching.
